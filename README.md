** THIS PUBLIC REPO DOES NOT AND SHALL NOT CONTAIN ANY COURSE WORK **

It's only purpose is to synchronise handy productivity hacks
for w4118's group projects.
I make it public in case any other students wanted to help get more out of
kernel hacking with some productivity hacks.

TAs: if this violates any academic policies, I sincerely apologise in advance
and will gladly take this repo down as soon as I'm told.
But until that I'll try my very best to make sure nothing here constitutes to
_actual coursework_.
